  <h1>Introduction</h1>
  <h2>Every semester, Harvard undergraduates find the  week before classes (shopping week) to be filled with advisor meetings, frantic 
    <i>"what's an easy gened"</i> texts to friends, and the inevitable crash of 
 my.harvard - the hub for course search, financial aid, and advisor directories. <br>
  With the stress of the semester and students scrambling to fit in interesting classes and concentration <i>(Harvard lingo for "major")</i> requirements, 
    searching for courses
  should be the easiest part. However, due to overwhelming and downright confusing design, important information about classes often gets lost - <b>making shopping week that much more difficult.</b><br><br></h2>

<div class="userside">
  <h1>Understanding the User</h1>
  <h2>When looking for classes for Spring 2021, I knew what I was going to prioritize given the remote learning model: Q Guide Scores, or Harvard lingo for the peer reviews of courses. When looking for classes, I wanted to compare how various teachers were adapting to Covid-19 and accomodations for online work - all features best described by other students. I know that in my course search process, I often find myself searching through syllabi for various testing policies and readings. Still, I wanted to better understand how my peers are using my.harvard and where their priorities lie. <br>
    I surveyed <b>27 undergraduates</b> via a self-reporting Google form. In my research, I primarily focused on the 3 screens that are the most vital to the course search process: <b>the initial course search page, the course listings page, and the course details popup.</b><br><br>
    <img src="images/3primaryscreens.png"><br>
    In my survey, I asked questions about student usage in a given semester, primary function of the my.harvard platform and most importantly, I presented students with the three screens above and found a variety of pain points.<br>
    <h3>User Pain Points</h3>
    <h2>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Pain Point 1: There is too much unimportant information on a given page.</b> Of those surveyed, 86% checked a box describing the screens as overwhelming and commented that the screens failed to prioritize the most vital information in choosing a course.</li><br>
      <li><b>Pain Point 2: The most important information to students is hidden or difficult to locate.</b> The majority of survey respondents commented that 3 notable items were difficult to find on every page -<i> 1.) Q Guide Information (peer reviews of classes), 2.) Syllabi access, and 3.) Canvas sites.</i></li><br>
      <li><b>Pain Point 3: There is no way to apply multiple filters at once without having to reload the page for each filter.</b> Eight survey respondents commented that in order to apply multiple filters in the course listing screen, they had to contiuously reload the page - slowing down the process.</li>
    </ul>

  <h1>So, why does this matter?</h1>
  <h2>Pre-Covid, shopping week was a fun, exciting week filled with small talk and excitement about the semester to come. During my freshman year, I could talk about classes with friends over meals at Berg. I could ask big sibs about class reccomendations as we walked to the Science Center. Professors were an office hour away and you could drop in between classes. Now, undergraduates are spending most of their time on the dreaded Zoom platform. Social isolation is on the rise and the process of going to an office hour or hopping on a call is draining. Making the course search function a bit easier and bit more intuitive could allow students to feel more excited about classes and remove one small burden in what is already an incredibly stressful and isolating academic environment.</h2>

<div class="theproblem">
  <h1>The Problem:</h1><h2><b>The My.Harvard course search feature doesn't prioritize relevant information and doesn't allow for enough customization in search.</b></h2>
  <h1>Goal:</h1><h2><b>To simplify the interface with more relevant information and to reduce search time for students.</b></h2>

<div class="designprocess">
  <h1>Design Process</h1>
  <h2>Okay, so I have a very 2020 confession - I <i>love</i> online shopping. So, when I started thinking about how to redesign the my.harvard course search, I thought back to the name "Shopping Week" and considered some of my favorite online retail experiences and what made them so compelling (aside from the unmatched glee from getting a package delivered). 
    <br> <br> So, I dove into my three personal favorite online retail sites: <b>Uniqlo, Glossier, and Amazon.</b> </h2>
  <img src="images/UNIQLO.png"><br><br>
  <img src="images/AMAZON1.png"><br><br>
  <img src="images/AMAZON2.png"><br><br>
  <img src="images/GLOSSIER.png"><br><br>
  <h2>Taking from my favorite shopping experiences, I dove into what I wanted to prioritize in my redesigns and mapped out a visual hierarchy. <br>
    <ul>
    <b>Priority One:</b> Relevant information given visual priority. <br>
    <b>Priority Two:</b> The ability to apply multiple filters at any point.
    </ul></h2>

    <h1>Final Designs</h1><br>
    <h2>Click <a href="https://www.figma.com/proto/tol7QRElvtx3CegVX4CEps/my.harvard-case-study?node-id=19%3A179&scaling=scale-down">here</a> for a full look at my final designs.</h2>

    <h2><b>Note: For privacy reasons, I was not allowed to show multiple Harvard course names. </b><br>
      In designs, I reimaigined the vertical scroll of current Harvard course listings into side by side boxes with sorting features in the hands of the users - opting to only put the information students told me was the most important to browsing courses at the front. I put the power of sorting and viewing into the user's hands - empowering them to search their way. I allowed for multiple filters to be applied at once with the hopes of allowing students to take ownership and hopefully cutting down on the course search time. <br><br>
      I hoped that side-by-side viewing would cut down on the current overwhelming nature of the search function and applied rounded edges with the hope of a softer, less stressful look. <br><br>
      <img src="images/Results 1.png">
      <img src="images/Results 10.png">
      I reimagined the way we search for classes - opting for a tag based system of keywords. With that, I hoped that finding a class about economics and data that met on Tuesdays could be streamlined by allowing users to go through that process from the start. <br><br>
      Most importantly, I listened to student priorities of Q Guide, syllabus, and Canvas access - puttting them in easy to spot locations. I framed the Q guide scores as a central part of the search and browse process in an effort to replicate the on-campus experience of asking around about favorite classes. With the addition of the "Highest Rating" bar on top, I allowed students to answer the question that fills the Harvard Confessions Facebook page : <i>"What's one Harvard class to take before I graduate?"</i><br><br>

    <h1>Final Thoughts</h1>
    <h2>Thank you for sticking with me all the way down here. This was such a fun experience and humanizing this process really made me miss Cambridge (even in the dead of winter) and made me that much more hopeful for the semester to come. <br><br>
      With a bit more time, this is what I would have looked at: <br>
      <ul>
        <li><b>How could I integrate the professor emails and contact information into the class cards? </b> For a lot of Harvard classes, students find themselves emailing professors during shopping week with a myriad of pre-requesite, support, and textbook questions. With more time, I would have implemented some button that streamlines that process.</li><br>
        <li><b>How can I allow for more professor cusotmization of their individual class cards?</b> I think there's a lot of room for professors to be able to link intorudction videos and personalized items within the cards - giving students that much more information about the classes.</li>
      </ul>
     
      And finally, here's what I learned:<br>
      <ul>
        <li><b>It is really, really difficult to organize a lot of information.</b> With so much information already available for each class, I found myself struggling to figure out how to create a precise visual hierarchy and to make sure that everything was clear. I don't think my current idea is just right yet but I was really happy with what I came up with.</li><br>
        <li><b>Research is key.</b> I am definitley a planner when it comes to my.harvard - I come into course search and already know exactly which classes I'm taking. So, many of the features that I was desigining were a bit foreign to me. Luckily through research (and many, many follow-up questions to friends), I was able to figure out user flows for various features and the different use cases.</li><br>
        <li><b>It's okay to not get it perfect the first time.</b> I will likely come back to this redesign many times  before I graduate. I don't think it's perfect and there are things that still aren't sitting 100% with me. I struggled a lot with putting it out here because I wasn't confident it was perfect. But, when I look back - I learned a lot about myself and my design processes through this and that's vital. I have a lot to learn about design and I couldn't be more excited to do it.</li>
      </ul>
