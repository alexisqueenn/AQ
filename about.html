  <h1>Hi there! I'm Alexis Queen, a product designer and a design thinking enthusiast.</h1>
  <h2>I'm a proud member of the Harvard class of 2023 studying cognitive science and statistics. <br>
    Originally, I'm  from sunny South Florida but recently traded constant summer for the culture and vibrancy of D.C .<br><br>
      When I'm in Cambridge (or on Zoom wishing I was in Cambridge), you'll find me: 
      <ul>
        <li>attending Institute of Politics events on topics I want to know more about</li>
        <li>frequently reading <i>The Crimson </i> and being in awe of student journalists</li>
        <li>eating all of the Ethiopian food and Pinocchio's Pizza I can feasibly eat in four years</li>
        <li>studying Korean and dreaming of visiting 서얼 one day soon</li>
        <li>taking city bikes along the Charles River and falling in love all over again with Fall</li>
        <li>rewatching and discussing my favorite HBO shows: Insecure, The Undoing, and Big Little Lies</li>
      </ul>

<div class="philosophy">
  <h1>Why design?</h1>
  <h2>In short,<i> I love questions</i>. My first loves were language and journalism and I found myself so deeply attracted to them because I wanted to know what questions to ask and how to ask them. <br><br>
    Design is all about knowing the right questions to ask and even more fun, asking the wrong ones. Answers are fun and they matter, but the process of finding your question is the key.

<div class="philosophy">
  <h1>What is design?</h1>
  <h2>Design is a <i> universal language </i>that affects every daily interaction. <br><br>
    Design is a <i>chain</i> between the most complicated mathematical theorems and the most abstract philosophical theories. <br><br>
    Design is <i>alive.</i> It's uniquely capable of growth and adaptation and the best designs are those that are never finished.

<div class="philosophy">
  <h1>How do I design?</h1>
  <h2>I design for <i> people. </i> I design with the user in mind - both I am akin to and those whom I couldn't be more different from.<br><br>
    I design <i> iteratively. </i> Designs are the product of hours of considerations, rediesigns, quick follow-up emails, and total scraps. <br><br>
    I design <i> imperfectly. </i> I'm never 100% satisfied with my designs because as the world grows, so does design.
