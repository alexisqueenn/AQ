  <h1>My Experience</h1>
  <h2>This past summer, I got the opportunity to join the FBU Class of 2021 for product design. This program, designed to teach new designers the basics and give them real-world experience, opened my eyes to the world of formal product design and the opportunities for growth in a tech environment. I was lucky enough to join the Instagram Well-Being team under the mentorship of Jasmine Oh. <br><br>Because my project is still under NDA, I can't detail the project or my solution to you (not until it launches at least!) but broadly, I worked on redesigning what happens when someone searches for an eating disorder-sensitive term on Instagram.
    <br>
    <br>
    This project was incredibly multi-faceted and I found myself chatting with numerous professionals and designers - from those that had worked on Instagram's election misinformation counter-tactics to those who had worked on protecting children on Facebook. I spent countless hours talking to psychologists and combing through the National Eating Disorder Association's research in an effort to flesh out what the best solution really was. And the truth is: I'm not sure I found it. In hindsight, some of my design proposals feel a bit too forceful on the user and might nto solve the stigma around eating disorders. With more time, I would have revisited these user indicators and would have ran user testing to ensure that my solutioons were making users feel more comfortable seeking help.

    <br>
    <br>

    But, what I failed at or what I feel my shortcomings are are the areas in which I learned the most. <b>Struggling to create a solution that combatted stigma taught me about emotive design and how to guide users rather than to direct them. Initially, I struggled with figuring out how to flesh out all of the aspects of previous designs that might have worked or not worked and from that, I learned how to build my own internal confidence in design. Instagram is a vast company with an even larger user base and I was forced to learn how to ensure that all of my designs are user-friendly for users that might differ in internet access, language, background, icon-association, and more.</b> <br> <br>

    Working at Instagram and under the mentorhsip of Jasmine Oh was an incredible experience that boosted my confidence, my skills, and strengthened my relationship to design. Choosing not to go back to Instagram this summer was a personal choice and was guided by my interest in exploring other applications of design that are more geared towards media rather than content. I had a wonderful and enriching team and hit the lottery with the opportunity to work with Instagram Well-Being.
